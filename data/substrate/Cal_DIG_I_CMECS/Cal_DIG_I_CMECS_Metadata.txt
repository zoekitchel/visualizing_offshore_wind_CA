    Description:
      Abstract: These metadata describe Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS; Federal Geographic Data Committee, 2012) attributed polygons derived from multibeam echosounder acoustic bathymetry and backscatter intensity data, and from underwater video collected offshore of Morro Bay, California from 2016 to 2020. The polygons have CMECS substrate, geoform and biotic component attributes. Most of the data were collected in support of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)/Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) California Deepwater Investigations and Groundtruthing I (Cal DIG I) project through collaborations with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).
      Purpose: This project was conducted to map surficial geology and benthic habitat as part of the USGS/BOEM Interagency Agreement M17PG0021 titled California Deepwater Investigations and Ground-truthing I (Cal DIG I). These data are intended to provide regional surficial geology and benthic habitat information in an area of interest for offshore wind energy development. These data are also intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the public. These data can be used in GIS and statistical analysis projects, or other software to spatially identify geomorphologic biota, surficial lithology, and biotopes in the study area. Field activities were augmented through the Expanding Pacific Research and Exploration of Submerged Systems (EXPRESS) collaboration (https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/science/express-expanding-pacific-research-and-exploration-submerged-systems?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects).
      Supplemental_Information:
        Additional information about the USGS field activities from which some of these data were derived is available online at:

        https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fan=2019-642-FA

        These data were collected for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)/Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) California Deepwater Investigations and Groundtruthing I (Cal DIG I) project (Interagency Agreement M17PG00021).

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The attributes found in this dataset are from the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS). The attribute values were derived from numerical classification of derivatives of multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry and backscatter intensity data. Derivatives of the bathymetry data include slope and bathymetry position index. The accuracy of these characteristics of the seafloor are dependent wholly on the vertical position accuracy of the MBES bathymetry. In general, the vertical accuracy of the Simrad EM710 MBES is on the order of decimeters. In this case noise in the data did create false slope and curvature in the data that cannot be quantified but appears to be on the order of meters. Video observations of seafloor substrate were used to supervise the numerical classification of backscatter intensity data (and bathymetry derivatives) into substrate type. Accuracy of the substrate is good near video transects and diminishes as a function of distance from video ground-truth information. This accuracy cannot be quantified. The substrate attribute values should be considered geologic interpretations by the user.
    Logical_Consistency_Report: Polygons do not overlap. Voids in the multibeam echosounder data were filled prior to numerical classification. No additional checks for consistency were performed on this data.
    Completeness_Report: Some polygons in this data set have null attribute values when the attribute value could not be ascertained from the data.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Hydrographic survey vessels outfitted with an Applanix POS-MV position and motion compensation system have a post-processed horizontal positional accuracy of about 0.1 m and roll and pitch accuracies of about 0.02 degrees (https://www.applanix.com/downloads/products/specs/posmv/POS-MV-WaveMaster-II.pdf). Accuracies of final products may be lower due to water depth and total propagated uncertainties of the mapping systems, which include sonar system, position and motion compensation system, and navigation, as well as data processing that includes sounding cleaning, gridding, and datum transformations.
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
        Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Polygons were assigned a depth class based on bathymetry data acquired for this study. The hydrographic surveys used for this dataset absolute difference statistics of the junctions between crossing lines show that 95 percentof soundings have a deviation of 1.3 meters or less. The vertical accuracy is not defined. https://data.ngdc.noaa.gov/platforms/ocean/nos/coast/H12001-H14000/H13151/DR/H13151_DR.pdf
