    Description:
      Abstract: Seafloor induration (surface hardness) was derived from multibeam echosounder (MBES) and annotated underwater video data collected offshore of Morro Bay, California, from 2016 to 2020. MBES and underwater video data were collected in support of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)/Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) California Deepwater Investigations and Groundtruthing I (Cal DIG I) project, under a collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Substrate observations from the underwater video were translated into Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS; Federal Geographic Data Committee, 2012) induration classes to use as training for a supervised classification of the MBES data. The induration raster is provided as a 10-meter resolution GeoTIFF.
      Purpose: This induration raster was used as a GIS layer in the analysis and classification of the study area into CMECS habitat polygons. This project was conducted to map surficial geology and benthic habitat as part of the USGS/BOEM Interagency Agreement M17PG0021 titled California Deepwater Investigations and Ground-truthing I (Cal DIG I). These data are intended to provide regional surficial geology and benthic habitat information in an area of interest for offshore wind energy development. These data are also intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the public. These data can be used with geographic information systems or other software to help identify geomorphologic features and surficial lithology. These data are not intended to be used for navigation.

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Not applicable for raster data.
    Logical_Consistency_Report: No formal logical accuracy tests were conducted.
    Completeness_Report: Dataset is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. Users are advised to read the rest of the metadata record carefully for additional details.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The POS MV position and motion compensation system used when collecting the MBES data has a horizontal positional accuracy of about 0.5 m with DGPS corrections and roll and pitch accuracies of about 0.02 degrees (http://www.measutronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/posmv320_specifications.pdf). Accuracies of final products may be lower due to water depth and total propagated uncertainties of the mapping systems, which include sonar system, position and motion compensation system, and navigation, as well as data processing that includes sounding cleaning, gridding, and datum transformations.

    Lineage:
      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: Multibeam echosounder (MBES) data were collected offshore of Morro Bay, California, from 2016 to 2019. The data were collected during five separate multi-agency surveys using Simrad 700 series hull-mounted multibeam echosounders. For details, see metadata for backscatter and bathymetry data, also available in this data release.
        Process_Date: 2020
      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: Substrate observations were derived from underwater video collected by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) offshore of Morro Bay, California. A majority of the data were acquired during three separate surveys in 2019. Additional observations from underwater video data collected by the Ocean Exploration Trust's E/V Nautilus in 2020 were also incorporated. See Kuhnz and others, 2021, for complete details.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: Multibeam echosounder (MBES) data were processed with HIPS and SIPS software into GeoTIFF bathymetry and backscatter-intensity rasters. The individual survey rasters were imported into an ArcGIS Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Bathymetry position index (BPI) and slope rasters were derived from MBES bathymetry data. The three variable rasters were then classified in ArcGIS 10.7 using the Maximum Likelihood Classification tools. Observations of substrate from the seafloor video were used to supervise the classification as described in Cochrane (2008). The induration grid was exported as a GeoTIFF file in UTM zone 10, NAD83 coordinates.
